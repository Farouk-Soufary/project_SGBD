# project_SGBD
This is a repo for SGBD project in 2nd year in Computer science, ENSEIRB-MATMECA, Bordeaux.

Follow these instructions in order to run properly the website, and so consult and modify our database.

Our website is PHP, JS, and SQL based, in order to run it you will need a localhost. 

you can either use WAMP (Windows) or XAMPP (Linux and MacOS).
Or visit our website online here (link).

If you're using WAMP the website should work properly, and you should just copy this repo to the Wamp64/www/ directory and access to the index.php manually in your browser.

In case your using XAMPP, LaunchDB.php might not work properly, we highly suggest you import manually create.sql and insert.sql manually to your local
PhpMyAdmin. click here to learn how to access your PhpMyAdmin.


In this repo you will find two different directories, the src/ directory is specific for the interface (website) code, scripts and assets. 

The sql/ directory contains all the sql code we use to manipulate, consult and analyze our database properly. You can run this code on Oracle, Mysql (our case) or MariaDB. 

The gamegen/ directory contains Python scripts that helped us create our insert.sql files and put random comments, names, games and other in a specific link and added them in their proper table.


Please contact us on : github , mail if you're finding any issues when running our web application. 
Thank you for your comprehension.
